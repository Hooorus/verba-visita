## 🔰About
### Who are We?
`Contributor 1` Yiming Liao
<br>
`Contributor 2` Carl Chang
<br>
I am currently in my senior year at university. 
My academic focus has been on Python, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. 
This specialized education has provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of technology and data analysis. 
Outside my studies, I find solace and balance through activities like meditation and contemplation. 
As I approach the end of my university journey, I am excited to explore opportunities where I can apply my skills and knowledge, particularly in innovative fields that leverage advanced technologies and data science.
### Why We Do?
1. Situation<br>
With the development of number in studying abroad of China, We have witnessed that most
student have the same problem in passing the Language test (writing & speaking shortages).
2. Problems<br>
Due to some irresistible situations, most Chinese cannot study English or even talk with Foreigners directly,
The only several ways they get lingual knowledge are from some specific websites, applications, and pay for professional language teachers.
3. Methods<br>
We came up with a creative idea, why not combine AI with Language to help these introverted students?
An AI Agent for Lingual Test and Speaking is coming...
