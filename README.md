### Why We Do?
1. Situation<br>
With the development of number in studying abroad of China, We have witnessed that most
student have the same problem in passing the Language test (writing & speaking shortages).
2. Problems<br>
Due to some irresistible situations, most Chinese cannot study English or even talk with Foreigners directly,
The only several ways they get lingual knowledge are from some specific websites, applications, and pay for professional language teachers.
3. Methods<br>
We came up with a creative idea, why not combine AI with Language to help these introverted students?
An AI Agent for Lingual Test and Speaking is coming...
